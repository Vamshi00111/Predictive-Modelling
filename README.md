# E-Commerce Data Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing e-commerce transactional data. The analysis includes filtering, summarizing, and visualizing key metrics to gain actionable insights. 

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Identified and removed invalid entries.
  - Replaced missing values with placeholders for categorical data.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Bar graphs for categorical variables like user level, gender, education, etc.
  - Line plots for daily and hourly order trends.

- **Business Insights**:
  - Identified peak order days and hours.
  - Analyzed the distribution of product prices and sales quantities.

- **Key Metrics**:
  - Orders with multiple packages were filtered.
  - Top price range with the highest orders identified.

## Visualizations
- Daily and hourly trends of quantity sold.
- Distribution of product prices (`original_unit_price` and `final_unit_price`).
- Bar graphs for user demographic distributions.


## Dataset Information
The analysis is based on anonymized e-commerce transactional data with the following key tables:
- **User Data**
- **Order Data**
- **Delivery Data**
- **Inventory Data**
- **Network Data**

## Future Enhancements
- Add predictive models for sales forecasting.
- Integrate dashboards for real-time monitoring.
